## Overview
Enhanced the attendance management functionality in the Employee module with improved UI/UX, proper API integration, and comprehensive CRUD operations.

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. AttendanceApiService Enhancements
- **Fixed paginated response handling**: Updated `getEmployeeAttendance` to properly handle API responses with `{ records: [...] }` format
- **Added comprehensive logging**: Implemented detailed logging for debugging API calls
- **Implemented CRUD operations**: Added `updateAttendanceByEmployeeAndDate` and `deleteAttendanceByEmployeeAndDate` methods
- **Proper error handling**: Enhanced error responses and user feedback

### 2. EmployeeContent.vue UI/UX Improvements

#### Modal Enhancements
- **Enhanced modal header**: Added icon, subtitle, and improved visual hierarchy
- **Smart form fields**: 
  - Required field indicators with red asterisks
  - Date field disabled when editing (date cannot be changed)
  - Time inputs grouped in a visual container
  - Help text for better user guidance

### 3. Technical Improvements

#### API Integration
- **Correct endpoints**: Using proper API endpoints as specified:
  - GET: `/api/hr/attendance/attendance/by-employee/${employeeId}`
  - PUT: `/api/hr/attendance/attendance/{employee_id}/{date}`
  - DELETE: `/api/hr/attendance/attendance/{employee_id}/{date}`
- **Proper authentication**: Using `getAuthHeaders()` for all API calls
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages

#### Form Validation
- **Required fields**: Date, Status, and Check-in time marked as required
- **Smart validation**: Check-out time must be after check-in time
- **Date restrictions**: Cannot select future dates for attendance records

#### User Experience
